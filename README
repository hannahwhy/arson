1. arson

Arson is a collection of Ember.js controls that I've built up whilst making
Ember.js applications.

You can get embers from committing arson, but you usually don't want to be
associated with it unless you can get away with it.  That ought to give you
some idea of whether or not you want to use this package.

2. Requirements

Arson is tested against, and should be used with, the latest release candidate
of Ember.js 1.0.  Some controls may have other requirements; e.g. various
jQuery UI modules.
